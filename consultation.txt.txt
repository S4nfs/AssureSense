[Speaker 1] Hi doctor
[Speaker 2] Yes, hi Bellamy its Harris. I'll be your doctor today. Let me just wash my hands really quick.
[Speaker 2] Would you prefer Miss Bellamy or? That's fine. Great. Can you tell me why you're here today? I have a terrible headache. It looks really bad. Is there anything else besides your headache that you want to address here today? The clinic appointment? No, it's just that. Except I am concerned.
[Speaker 2] We just recently changed insurance companies and I'm not sure this is going to be covered yet.
[Speaker 2] Alright, Mom, was there anything 'cause what we can do is while we're talking and I'm doing your history and physical, I will have my office secretary look and do what the insurance plan that you have so you don't have to worry about that. OK, sounds great. Is there anything else?
[Speaker 2] No, I just, this is just really bad. OK, So what I'd like to do today, and this was, let's take a look at what's causing your headache. I will go over history, physical and then we'll do again a physical exam and then we will look into your insurance policy and make sure that's all, you know, taken care of. That sounds like a good plan for you. Perfect.
[Speaker 2] So tell me a little bit more about this the head head pain that.
[Speaker 3] You're having, well it started about 3 days ago and.
[Speaker 3] Nothing has helped it it's it's just laid me flat. I haven't been able to go to work.
[Speaker 3] It's nothing's helped. I, I, it's, it's all over.
[Speaker 3] I it's really bad when I move so try not to move to much and the light is bothering me a lot.
[Speaker 2] OK, and unfortunately I can't dim the lights in this room, but so I'll try to go quickly and would be OK if I took some notes. All right, so you said this headache started about 3 days ago, Okay.
[Speaker 2] Was there any, anything that brought about anything unusual that happened maybe 3 days ago? Really, no.
[Speaker 2] OK. Can you tell me anything that makes it better?
[Speaker 3] Is there nothing's?
[Speaker 3] Made it better I.
[Speaker 3] Some Tylenol like Motrin, Nothing. I just try not to move too much.
[Speaker 2] Alright.
[Speaker 2] Umm, is there anything that makes it worse? Like move?
[Speaker 3] Movement.
[Speaker 3] And and light OK and.
[Speaker 3] It's just constant though. There's, you know, it doesn't. It's just constant. It's it's all over, OK.
[Speaker 2] Umm, so if you had to rate another pain scale, umm 0 being no pain, 10 being the worst pain you ever had.
[Speaker 3] To 10A10. I've never had a.
[Speaker 3] Headache like this.
[Speaker 2] OK, yeah, that sounds really bad. Umm. Now as far as radiation, does it move? Does it that you said the head? The pain is all?
[Speaker 2] Up here in the front of your head, it's kind of all over, OK?
[Speaker 3] But it it also I've got this.
[Speaker 3] Shooting pain down my neck and my neck is is very stiff, OK.
[Speaker 3] But it's not it's it's, it's an entire head.
[Speaker 2] Tyre head OK, um.
[Speaker 2] As far as in the, in the timing, you said that uh, started three days ago, but is it, you said it's a constant or it comes?
[Speaker 3] And goes it started gradually but once once it.
[Speaker 3] Got there. It's hasn't gone away. It doesn't.
[Speaker 3] Get better. It doesn't get worse. It's just the same. OK, um.
[Speaker 2] So do you.
[Speaker 2] What I want to get is your perception of what you.
[Speaker 3] Think is going on I just.
[Speaker 3] Can hardly think it's so painful I I just because it's so bad. I was afraid my neighbour had a headache and.
[Speaker 3] Ignore it last year and I suddenly started having seizures and it turns out to get a a brain tumour so I thought I I just.
[Speaker 2] Should come in and yeah, I can understand your concern. Umm.
[Speaker 2] What? How is it impacting your daily life?
[Speaker 3] I can't go to work OK.
[Speaker 3] I can't do anything. Yeah, OK.
[Speaker 2] So it sounds like it's really impacting your.
[Speaker 3] Life and OK.
[Speaker 2] If it's OK, I would like to go some talk about a little bit about your medical history and your social history. All right. Can you tell me as far as your medical history, do you have any medical conditions I should be aware of?
[Speaker 3] Not I was diagnosed with high blood pressure about 3 years ago, but we've been addressing it with diet changes.
[Speaker 2] With diet, yeah, I go in.
[Speaker 3] Yearly I had been just and it's been well controlled so OK great. Haven't been on medication. No, that's for that. Other than that I.
[Speaker 2] Haven't had any problems. OK, Any surgical history, any hospitalizations, All right. And you said you're the only medicine you're taking was the Tylenol, Motrin, but it does help. OK, Just wanted to verify. Do you have any drug allergies?
[Speaker 2] OK, what about family history?
[Speaker 2] Do you have any medical history of headaches or?
[Speaker 3] In my family right now, father, you know.
[Speaker 3] My mom said she used to get migraines when she was in her 20s and 30s. OK but I don't remember.
[Speaker 3] Or say anything else about it. My sister, uh, everyone's sister, she's, she's healthy. My dad, uh, he has a high blood pressure rather than that he's healthy.
[Speaker 3] That's about it. I don't. I don't.

[Speaker 3] Oh, I'm. I'm.
[Speaker 3] In menopause, OK.
[Speaker 2] Umm, so going back into the history again, umm have you umm.
[Speaker 2] You said your mom had migraines, umm, earlier on umm have you been around and you know other you haven't been nauseous or have you been?
[Speaker 3] Yes, I've been nauseous.

[Speaker 2] Nothing out of the ordinary over the past couple weeks. Have you been on?
[Speaker 2] Any trips or?
[Speaker 3] Anything or I actually a minute ago I was in North Carolina for a family reunion. OK, and there was.
[Speaker 3] Mayoral, who was sick there, I, I don't know what they had, but OK, I guess, I guess they ended up taking.
[Speaker 2] Alright so let me just summarise to make sure I've got everything straight so far is umm, you start hitting an onset of a severe headache about 3 days ago. Umm, it's worse with movement and light really makes it hurt bad. Umm it's a 10 out of 10 pain and you're also complaining of a stiff neck with that. Umm, it came on gradually and it's been constant pain in the frontal area. Umm medical history, urine hyper, you have had blood pressure but that's umm controlled with diet.
[Speaker 2] No surgical history, no really hospitalisation.
[Speaker 2] The pain that was really impacting your day to day living your daily life.
[Speaker 2] You took try to Tylenol, Motrin. It didn't help. Otherwise, no medications. You've got the family history of your mom with migraines. Otherwise your family is healthy. You smoke about half a pack a day. You don't drink.
[Speaker 2] And then you were you. You said you took a trip about a week ago or two weeks ago. OK, Yeah.
[Speaker 3] What's in North Carolina?
[Speaker 2] All right, umm, yeah, I can understand your concern about your friends. You said that was having seizures. Umm.
[Speaker 3] I've just never had this kind of pain before.
[Speaker 2] Yeah, and I can understand that and.
[Speaker 2] You know, umm. So what I would like to do is umm.
[Speaker 2] We've pretty much gone over your the history. What I'd like to do is complete a physical exam, do some testing, and I want to ask you if there's any other concerns I need to address before we get to that final exam. OK, That, that sounds good. OK, sounds great. OK.
[Speaker 3] All right. Hi, I'm Dan. I'm yours standardised patient.
[Speaker 3] Nice job.
